- Add tasks to each resolution and mark them as complete
- View progress on each resolution through a progress bar
- User authentication and authorization for secure access to individual resolution lists

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB for data storage
- Express for backend API routing
- React for frontend UI
- Node.js for runtime environment
- TypeScript for static type checking and improved code reliability

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Set up a MongoDB database and update the connection string in the `.env` file
4. Run `npm run start` to start the development server
